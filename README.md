# City-Wide-Delivery-Platform
The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for sustainable solutions have driven the need for innovative delivery systems. In urban areas, traditional delivery methods often lead to congestion and pollution. By leveraging electric vehicles and a centralized delivery platform, I can create a system that not only meets the logistical needs of a city but also promotes environmental sustainability.<br>
This platform will function as a portal where merchants can schedule their deliveries to a central location. From there, electric vehicles will handle the last-mile delivery within the city. By organizing deliveries into several waves throughout the day, the system will optimize the use of vehicles, ensuring they carry the maximum number of products per trip. This approach minimizes the number of trips and reduces the overall carbon footprint.<br>
